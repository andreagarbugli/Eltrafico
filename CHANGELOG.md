**1.3.0**
- Switch from `lsof` to `ss` and from `ifconfig` to `ifstat`so now `eltrafico` only depends on `iproute2` which is a core pkg as far as I know. Also add a check in case someone actually doesn't have it

**1.2.0**
`Gui` improvements:
  - App box is now vertically scroll-able
  - program names have the same width

**1.1.1**
Initial Release
